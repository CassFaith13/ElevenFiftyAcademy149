A markdown file is denoted by the extension .md

The markdown language is used for creating plain-text. HTML (hyper text markup language) uses the markup language and extends upon it.

The markdown file is popularly used to create README files that goes over your project and explains the functionality, features, extensions, etc.

```
Three backticks will create a code box.

It will stay that way until the system (or code) encounters another three backticks.
```

```
{
    My code goes here.
}
```

If you are typing some info and you want to **BOLD** text, you would use two asterisks. 

**This is how you bold multiple words.**

To _italicize_ use a single underscore.

_This is how you italicize multiple words._

**_This is now BOLD and ITALIC!_**

If we want to bring attention to a single word and make it a `code` you can use a single backtick before and after the word. (This is useful to bring in a command).

`Whatever you type in between single backticks will become code.`

To create a hyperlink in my markdown file: [Saucy Mickey!](URL)

Insert the image itself, but no link attached to it: 
![Mickey](https://toppng.com/uploads/preview/mickey-mouse-11530968610bkjpvgdnv6.png)

Alt text is important! Accessibility so that's why it's important to use ![].

To make an image a hyperlink:
[![Micky Lounging](https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/mickey-mouse-8-logo-png-transparent.png)](URL)
